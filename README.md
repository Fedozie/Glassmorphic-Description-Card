# Glassmorphic-Description-Card

I created this project as a tie-in to an article I wrote on trendy UI style called Glassmorphism. I intentionally left it incomplete as to allow people to add their own style and encourage open source and allow for more hands-on learning.

If you just happened on this article and have never heard about Glassmorphism, you should definitely check out my article. I think it's very easily explained and won't be difficult to understand.
